Hi!

I am Zhe, a full-stack developer who lives in Göteborg, Sweden. I grew up in <a href="http://goo.gl/maps/vfld"
target="_blank">Jinan</a>, China.

I did my bachelor in Materials Chemistry and studied master program for Systems Biology/Bioinformatics in Sweden in 2006. In 2008 I started working as a test developer and later moved on to web backend development. Currently I am working for [Minna Technologies](https://minnatechnologies.com/), using Scala, Kubernetes and React.

I like lean startup and micro-entrepreneurship and I want to write more:) Some of my projects are listed below.
