# Jekyll Content Standards

## Blog Post Format
- Use YAML front matter for all posts with required fields:
  ```yaml
  ---
  layout: post
  title: "Your Post Title"
  date: YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS
  categories: [category1, category2]
  tags: [tag1, tag2]
  ---
  ```

## File Naming Conventions
- Published posts: `YYYY-MM-DD-title-with-hyphens.md` in [_posts/](mdc:_posts/)
- Draft posts: `title-with-hyphens.md` in [_drafts/](mdc:_drafts/)
- Use lowercase with hyphens, no spaces or special characters

## Content Guidelines
- Write in Markdown format using kramdown parser
- Use descriptive titles that reflect the content
- Include relevant categories and tags for organization
- Keep posts focused and well-structured
- Use proper heading hierarchy (H1 for title, H2 for sections, etc.)

## Draft Workflow
- Create new posts in [_drafts/](mdc:_drafts/) folder
- Test locally with `bundle exec jekyll serve --draft --livereload`
- When ready to publish, move to [_posts/](mdc:_posts/) with proper date prefix
- Commit and push to trigger GitHub Pages deployment

## Code Blocks
- Use triple backticks with language specification for syntax highlighting
- Example: ```python for Python code blocks
- Include descriptive comments in code examples

## Images and Assets
- Store images in [assets/](mdc:assets/) directory
- Use relative paths in markdown: `![alt text](../assets/image.jpg)`
- Optimize images for web (compress, appropriate formats)
