March 7th, 2020 is my 3rd anniversary at Minna Technologies. It feels like I
have been at Minna for much longer because so many things have happened. Maybe
one startup year equals three corporate years? :stuck_out_tongue:

Looking back I never thought we could become this big this quick. Imagine
walking into an attic crowded with developers, having a discussion with some
due who just graduated from school few years ago and you have no idea how the
service could make money.

So it was a hard decision to make. I just quit a job from a "start-up" and my plan
was to try to build my own SaaS business with some contract work on the side. I
was reaching 40 and I didn't want to waste any time.

One of my smartest friends was there and he thinks Minna has many awesome
developers. And that was one of the reasons I joined. If people are awesome they
will figure things out. After all, ideas are cheap and they change all the time.
So I trust my gut feeling and joined Minna. And it became one of the best
decisions I've made in my life.

It will be interesting to see what Minna will archive in the future.
