March 7th, 2020 is my 3rd anniversary at Minna Technologies. It feels like I
have been at Minna for much longer because so many things have happened. Maybe
one startup year is like three corporate years?

Looking back I never thought we could become this big this quick. Imagine
walking into an attic crowded with developers, having a discussion with some
founder who just graduated from school and you have no idea how the service
could make money.

So when I got home after the first meeting, I wasn't thinking
about how big the company would be in five years, it's more like do I have to
find another job in 6 months. But in the end I decided to trust my gut feeling
and join Minna. And it became one of the best decisions I've made in my life.

It will be interesting to see what Minna will archive in the next 3 years.
