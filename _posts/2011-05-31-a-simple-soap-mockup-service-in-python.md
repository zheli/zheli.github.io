I was dealing with SOAP tests a lot last month, and WireShark is little too much for simply checking a SOAP request. So I made a little script to show (not capture) the package content. It might be helpful if one needs automated SOAP testing as well. It&#8217;s very tiny (26 lines if use without Gzip) and doesn&#8217;t depend on any other modules.
