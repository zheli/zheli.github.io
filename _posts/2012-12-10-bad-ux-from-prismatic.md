I was just like many others who signed up on Prismatic last week after read <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/12/05/prismatic/" target="_blank">this post on TechCrunch</a>. While I enjoyed some of the articles from it (I guess AI is still learning about my interests), there is one thing disturbs me when I checked my twitter today.

All of the articles I checked on Prismatic app were shared on my Twitter (and probably also could be on Facebook, but I didn&#8217;t grant them:)), instead of what I wanted to share. Unfortunately later I figured out how to turn off sharing on Prismatic&#8217;s website, but it is still very annoying. My friends must think my account was hijacked and turned into a spamming machine&#8230;

P.S. I will remove all those tweets later so you probably will not see them now.
