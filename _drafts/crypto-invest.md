# Outlines
## introduction
Cryptocurrency investment is one of the hottest topics on the Internet right
now. You probably have seen hundreds stories from both sides. On one hand there
are stories about teenagers who became billionaires because of some coins
purchased years ago, on the other hand countless investors and governments have
called cryptocurrency scam. Nevertheless the sector is getting too big to
ignore. One question you might ask is: how can I get started in cryptocurrency
investment?

## risk warning
First thing you have to understand is the risk, which comes with any kind of
investment. Cryptocurrency is a risky sector, it can be more risky than stocks.
Of course it's all relative: a good solid project like Bitcoin might be less
risky than some trashy penny stocks. But you should always be prepared to loss
all or part of the investment. That is the cost of having potential good return.

Luckily there are ways to minimize it. But that's a topic for another day.

## start from small
Getting into a new area can be overwhelming, where should I start? Here are
three simple steps you can follow:
### small investment
Allocate some amount of money. It should small enough that you won't have a
problem in losing, but still can make some meaningful trades. For me, that
amount is $200 US dollars.

A good thing with cryptocurrency investment is that you can start out with as
little money as $10 US dollars.

### small risks
Pick cryptocurrencies that has less risk when you start out. In cryptocurrency,
that means high market capitalization. For example, Bitcoin and Ethereum is
considered to be less riskier than SHIBA INU coin. An easy way to find this kind
of coins is to look at the 20 projects in https://coinmarketcap.com/ ranked by
market cap.

You can of course buy other small cap cryptocurrency as well. Just make sure the
majority (>70%) of your portfolio consists of less risky cryptocurrencies.

### small groups
You shouldn't just put all your eggs in one basket, but make sure that you don't
have too many different kinds of cryptocurrencies either. You probably need to
read up a lot when you just started and the last thing you want is to divide
your attentions. Things are happening at much higher rate in crypto space.

When you have a good understanding of blockchain technologies, you can gradually
start adding more coins into your portfolio.

## how to buy cryptocurrency
This is the question everyone asks when they started. How to buy cryptocurrency
with their native currency(fiat)? In cryptocurrency world, this is called
on-ramp.

It has definitely become easier compares to the early days. In the beginning
most people got their Bitcoin from local meetup, online forum, mostly for free.
Some also got their crypto currency via mining. Nowadays there are thousands
of on-ramp services with great user experience to choose from. Here are the
suggestions I give to my friend:

### exchange
For most people, the easiest way is to buy your first cryptocurrency from
exchange. Exchanges usually have an onboard process to guide new people
through their first purchase. A few of them even have bonus for new users.

You can usually pay with bank transfer or credit card.
