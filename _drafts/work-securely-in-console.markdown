At Minna we take security very seriously, since we are working with critical personal financial
 data. And that is even more important as an operation team member. In this post I just want to
 share some tips I used in my daily work.

# Credentials
It's important to use strong password, as well as not re-using the same password. The easiest
 way is using a password manager. The msot secure password is the one you don't remember.
 Personally I recommend [Lastpass][lastpass-ref]. There are many sources online regarding to
 its security design of Lastpass, with the most famous one being from
 [Steve Gibson][steve-gibson]. It's free to use on all devices, I paid for their premium
 plan because I like the company and I want they to survive.

# Final Thoughts
And finally, a system is only as secure as its weakest points. So don't forget to educate your colleagues :)
